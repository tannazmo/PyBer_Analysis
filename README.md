# Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is by using the raw data, to create a number of charts to visualize the dynamic between type of communities (Urban, Suburban and Rural) and numbers of riders and drivers as well as the percentages of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. This analysis should help the ride sharing company PyBer to be able to make decisions about which types of cities need more driver support

## Results:

We first merged the two data files by their common element which was the name of the city to have one DataFrame showing all the infomation for this analysis.

We then split the main DataFrame into three different DataFrames for each type of city. We were then able to create reports and numbers and charts that would help the CEO and stakeholders in PyBer to decide which type of city needs more support and investment.

We calculated the number of rides for each city type, the average fare for each city type and number of drivers for each city type. With these info, we were able to create a bubble chart that would show all that in one single chart, as below:


![Pyber_Ride_Sharing](/analysis/Fig1.png "PyBer Ride-Sharing Data")

We then created the statistcal summaries for Number of Rides, Fares and Number of Drivers by city type and created a whisker and box plot to see if there are any outliers in the data that we have and also where our minimums and maximums are, figures as below:


![Ride_Count_Data](/analysis/Fig2.png "Ride Count Data")
![Ride_Fare_Data](/analysis/Fig3.png "Ride Fare Data")
![Driver_Count_Data](/analysis/Fig4.png "Driver Count Data")

We then calculated the percentages of Urban, Suburban and Rural areas for the Total Fares, Total Rides and Total Drivers and to showcase them the best, we used pie charts that best show the shares of a whole, like percetages. figures shown:

![Percentage_of_Total_Fares](/analysis/Fig5.png "Percentage of Total Fares")
![Percentage_of_Total_Rides](/analysis/Fig6.png "Percentage of Total Rides")
![Percentage_of_Total_Drivers](/analysis/Fig7.png "Percentage of Total Drivers")




There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the **total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type**. (7 pt)

## Summary:

By looking at the first bubble chart that we plotted, we can clearly see that the number rides are lower in Rural areas comparing to suburban and then urban which makes total sense because of the density of population, but what also catches the attention is that the fares are much higher in the rural areas, which can also be a factor for lower ridership. Pyber, can lower the fares for rural areas by increasing the number of drivers and most probably lower the wait times and this can also help increasing the ridership.

✓There is a description of the differences in the ride-sharing data for ALL SIX metrics by city type. 

✓There is a statement summarizing THREE business recommendations addressing disparities among the city types.
